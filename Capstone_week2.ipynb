As vehicular accidents are one of the most common causes for fatalities and injuries, this project aims to build a model that can predict the severity of accidents based on information such as its location, the weather, road conditions and light conditions. This can help city planners consider if certain junctions in the cities need to be redesigned and also help in planning the development of fire stations and police stations.
